    <p><strong>Tenacious D</strong> is an American comedy rock duo, formed in Los Angeles, California in 1994. It was founded by actors Jack Black and Kyle Gass, who were part of The Actors' Gang theater company at the time. The duo's name is derived from "tenacious defence" - a phrase used by NBA basketball sportscaster Marv Albert.</p>
<br>
<p>Prior to the release of Tenacious D's 2001 debut album Tenacious D, the duo had a three-episode TV series released on HBO, with the episodes broadcasting between 1997 to 2000. These episodes came about after the band had met David Cross and Bob Odenkirk on the Los Angeles music scene â€” and Black featuring in episodes of Mr. Show with Bob and David. The band also befriended former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl, and this would begin a working relationship between Foo Fighters and Tenacious D. Towards the end of the 1990s, the duo would go on to support large rock acts - such as Pearl Jam, Tool and Beck.</p>
<br>
<p>In 2000, they signed with Epic Records, and the year after released Tenacious D, their debut album featuring a full band - this including Grohl on the drums. The first single, "Tribute", has since achieved cult-status, and made the band popular overseas, this being mainly the United Kingdom and Australia. In 2003, Tenacious D released their first concert DVD - The Complete Master Works, which went on to achieve gold and platinum status by the RIAA.</p>
<br>
<p>In 2006, they starred in, and recorded the soundtrack for, the film Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny. In support of the film, the band went on a world tour, appearing for the first time with a full lineup - as up until this point, Black and Gass had only performed acoustically. The film failed to obtain back its $20 million USD production costs, grossing just under $14 million at the box office.</p>
<br>
<p>After the completion of The Pick of Destiny world tour in 2007, the band made sporadic appearances, mainly at the likes of benefit concerts and festivals. Their third album Rize of the Fenix, was released on May 15, 2012, and made jokes regarding The Pick of Destiny's failure - with the duo describing Rize of the Fenix as a "comeback record". The duo have teased an animated series since 2012, and in 2018, Black mentioned a "part 2" to The Pick of Destiny was being released at a live concert, with the tease of a new album in a form of an animated trailer, posted to the band's website and social media the week after.</p>
<br>
<p>Tenacious D's music showcases Black's theatrical vocal delivery and Gass' acoustic guitar playing abilities. Critics have described their fusion of vulgar absurdist comedy with rock music as "mock rock". Their songs discuss the duo's purported musical and sexual prowess, as well as their friendship and cannabis usage in a style that music critics have compared with the storyteller-style lyrics of rock opera.</p>
